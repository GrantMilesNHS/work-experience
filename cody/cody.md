Hello my name is Cody

I have had experience on inferstructure and learnt that they have their own special phones that have a security system on that James
can monitor and see if anything is wrong

Over the next few days i shall be learning about how HTML and CSS works

whilst working with the development team i hope to learn more about how git and github works
