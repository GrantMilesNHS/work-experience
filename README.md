# Kent & Medway NHS Social Care Partnership Trust Work Experience

## Expected Outcome
While working with the development team you will be expected to join the rest of the team and take part in all team activities. To get the best out of the experience you will be working to towards creating a proof of concept application for viewing patients. The detials, scope and expectations will all be set on your first day where you will be joined by a developer for a planning session to 

1. Agree the end goal from your time with us
1. Break down the requirements into smaller tasks
1. Ask lots of questions to confirm understanding

## Milestone One

The first milestone while working with us will be to gain a basic understanding of version control. 

You will be tasked with writing a small report where you will save, add, commit & push your changes regularly to create a vivid document history and if time allows follow best practice by putting your changes up for peer review whereby you will be able to receive feedback on how to improve "code". 

The expectations for milestone one are:

1. Write a few paragraphs about what you are hoping to get out of your work experience while working with the developement team OR a few paragraphs about version control and its pro's and cons. 
    * Both options will require a small amount of planning
    * Option 1 will not require research so you will be able to focus efforts on your commit history 
    * Option 2 will require some research but the code review will allow a peer to confirm understanding


## Milestone Two

The second milestone will be to construct a patient viewer application using HTML that covers the below user story. This story will be discussed and broken down in a planning session. 

*As a ward admin I would like to be able to see all of the patients on a given ward so that I can monitor who is currently on the ward for things like ward rounds, nurse assignments and general information. This will be achieved when at a glance I am able to see relevant patient information about who is currently on my ward so that I can use that information to share with other HCP's or access the patient record*

The expectation for this milestone are:

1. Combine what has been learnt with Git in milestone one and save, add, commit and push at regular intervals to create a rich history.
1. Create a very basic HTML page with a section for patient information
1. Present your first version for early feedback
1. As an extension look into CSS Styling to see how we can enchance the design with styling.

## Milestone Three

The thrid and final milestone will be to take the discovery of day 1 and 2 and take th basic sample into an interactive, intuitive user interface. To do this you will use JavaScript to access an API (this will be supplied) so that your HTML page can be dynamically created. 

The expectations for this milestone are: 

1. Combine the learnings of milestone one and two and continue to generate good version history by regularly saving, adding, committing and pushing
1. Load data dynamically using JavaScript to call an API
1. Update the user interface to iterate the data so you can dynamically display the results
1. As an extension look into other ways to make the application "Production Ready". This is your chance to be creative and offer enhancements to the end user.
