Review of useing GitHub

What I did:

1. Firslty, I had to create an account for GitHub.
2. After this, I accessed the repository with the tasks that had been set.
3. To carry out such tasks, I needed to install the software I would need with the likes of Visual studio code and git bash.
4. I next made a fork and started to edit the document. 
5. Following through https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-basics-of-git-in-under-10-minutes-da548267cc91/ I applied my changes to my repositroy.
6. I then applied the changes administered from the pull request on visual studio code and once again commited this to the repository.

How it went:

Downloading the software and making the account was relativly easy but it just took some playing around with. My frist major issue I encounteretd was accesing the source of the file and changing the dictonary so I could access the right files. This was fixed by looking at the file lists with the command 'ls' and then changing the source with 'cd source' and 'cd work-experiance' which was the name of the folder. I then followed the website accordingly but strugguled with the execution of some of the instructions. With the help of Grant, I then enterted the following commands to receive the the desired result. This followed as 'git add README.md' to add the file I wanted to submit, then I used 'git commit -m "" to capture a version of the document as it is currently. It is then finally pushed with 'Git push' applying my changes to GitHub for them to be approved. 

what I learned:

I learned how to use GitHub on a basic which will be good to know incase I need to use this in the furture. The experiance itslef will also be good for seeing what it is like working in a team environment. I can also use this for my personal statement and univeristy application along with giving me something to talk about in interviews.
